# wireframing
<h1 align="center">About</h1>
<p>Wireframing is a blueprint or skeletal framework of a website or an application. It outlines the basic structure and layout without delving into detailed design elements like colors, fonts, or images. Wireframes focus on the placement of elements, navigation flow, and overall user interface structure.</p>
